# Student-Information-Organizational-System

## 1 Introduction

**1.1 Document overview**
The purpose of this document is to provide the user with an understanding of the design and implementation of the software. The document will provide an overview of the high-level properties of the software, including user interfaces, architectural design, and software design principles. Diagrams made with the unified modeling language (UML) will provide a visual aid to ensure transparency when understanding the development of the software. Additionally, the document will briefly discuss the subject of race conditions within the software. The components of the software will be discussed and provide an in-depth analysis of their function and purpose.


**1.2 Purpose of Software**
Every individual student contains information pertaining to their academic performance. This information includes grades and enrolled courses. It is crucial to be able to efficiently and reliably calculate final grades for each course that a student is enrolled in. Developing student information organizational software is an effective method of being able to achieve this goal.



**1.3 Software Goals**
The goal of this software is that it adheres to a design in which inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are utilized for maximum performance capabilities. Additionally, the simplicity and accessibility of this software should allow devices running Windows, Mac, or Linux-based operating systems to perform their duties with minimal disruptions and technical difficulties, as it is intended to be designed with an offensive programming approach. Aimed to be designed and programmed using the Java language, ideally, the software can be easily manipulated to comply with more specific or individual needs its user may have. Organized source code will allow the user to perform necessary alterations to the implementation to accept file types of various data types and input formats, which includes the opportunity to export organized data in more personalized ways that its users may find suitable. Additionally, the capabilities of the software program should be endless as future updates and deployments can include user-friendly'Graphical User Interfaces.
