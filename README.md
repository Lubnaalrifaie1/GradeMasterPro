# Student-Information-Organizational-System

## 1 Introduction

**1.1 Document overview**
The purpose of this document is to provide the user with an understanding of the design and implementation of the software. The document will provide an overview of the high-level properties of the software, including user interfaces, architectural design, and software design principles. Diagrams made with the unified modeling language (UML) will provide a visual aid to ensure transparency when understanding the development of the software. Additionally, the document will briefly discuss the subject of race conditions within the software. The components of the software will be discussed and provide an in-depth analysis of their function and purpose.


**1.2 Purpose of Software**
Every individual student contains information pertaining to their academic performance. This information includes grades and enrolled courses. It is crucial to be able to efficiently and reliably calculate final grades for each course that a student is enrolled in. Developing student information organizational software is an effective method of being able to achieve this goal.



**1.3 Software Goals**
The goal of this software is that it adheres to a design in which inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are utilized for maximum performance capabilities. Additionally, the simplicity and accessibility of this software should allow devices running Windows, Mac, or Linux-based operating systems to perform their duties with minimal disruptions and technical difficulties, as it is intended to be designed with an offensive programming approach. Aimed to be designed and programmed using the Java language, ideally, the software can be easily manipulated to comply with more specific or individual needs its user may have. Organized source code will allow the user to perform necessary alterations to the implementation to accept file types of various data types and input formats, which includes the opportunity to export organized data in more personalized ways that its users may find suitable. Additionally, the capabilities of the software program should be endless as future updates and deployments can include user-friendly'Graphical User Interfaces.

## 2 System Overview

**2.1 Architectural Design**
The architectural design of the Student-Information-Organizational-System will be based on a modular approach, ensuring each component functions independently yet integrates seamlessly. Utilizing a layered architecture, the system will consist of a user interface layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer. This separation of concerns not only improves maintainability but also allows for easier debugging and testing of individual components.

**2.2 User Interface Design**
The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to users with varying degrees of technical expertise. The interface will include clear navigation menus, interactive components for data input, and visual representations of student information. Accessibility features will also be incorporated to ensure the software is usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities.

**2.3 Data Management**
The software will be equipped with robust data management capabilities. This includes secure storage of student information, efficient retrieval of data, and mechanisms to handle large volumes of data without performance degradation. Data integrity and privacy will be paramount, with encryption and secure data handling practices implemented.

## 3 Technical Specifications

**3.1 Programming Language and Frameworks**
As intended, Java will be the primary programming language due to its platform-independent nature and wide adoption in enterprise applications. Java frameworks and libraries will be used to streamline development, improve code maintainability, and enhance functionality.

**3.2 Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation**
Object-oriented programming principles – inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation – will be at the core of the software’s design. These principles will aid in creating a flexible, scalable, and easily maintainable codebase.

**3.3 Compatibility and Accessibility**
The software will be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Efforts will be made to ensure the software adheres to accessibility standards, making it usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

**3.4 Security and Data Protection**
Given the sensitivity of student data, security will be a critical aspect. The software will incorporate advanced security measures, including data encryption, secure login mechanisms, and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
